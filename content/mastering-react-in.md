React has evolved into a comprehensive framework for building dynamic, scalable web apps. In 2025, itâ€™s not just about JSX and hooks â€” it's about full-stack integration and high performance.

### ðŸš€ Example: A Simple React Component

```jsx showLineNumbers {3}
import React from 'react';

function Welcome() {
  return <h2>Hello from React 2025 ðŸ‘‹</h2>;
}

export default Welcome;
