Choosing the right CSS framework is key to development speed and design quality. Let’s compare Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap — two of the most popular tools.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Bootstrap**: Pre-built UI components with default styling  
- **Tailwind**: Utility-first, atomic styling using classes

## ⚙️ Customization

- Tailwind allows full design freedom  
- Bootstrap is faster for ready-made UIs, but harder to customize deeply

## 🧱 Use Cases

- **Tailwind**: Startups, custom designs, design systems  
- **Bootstrap**: Admin panels, internal tools, rapid prototyping

## 💥 Performance

- Tailwind with PurgeCSS = smaller bundle size  
- Bootstrap includes everything by default

## 💡 Example: A Simple Button in Both

### 🌀 Tailwind CSS Button

```html showLineNumbers
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Tailwind Button
</button>
