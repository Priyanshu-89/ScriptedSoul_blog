Handling asynchronous code is a vital part of modern JavaScript development. With `async/await`, it's easier to write readable and maintainable code.

## ðŸ’¡ What is Async/Await?

- `async` turns a function into a Promise
- `await` pauses function execution until the Promise resolves

```js showLineNumbers
async function fetchUserData() {
  const res = await fetch("/api/user");
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
}
